# Tourism-Management-System 

-> Most of the people in this world like to travel from one place to another no matter whether it is a small or large distance. The need for a tourism management system that can manage tourism information with ease is sought after by every tour management company. This travel and tourism application is designed for travel agencies by which they can manage different tour packages based on the destinations. By using this, the tour company can tailor tour packages spanning various destinations at almost every price point. Customers can find the right tour package for them at every budget, depending on the tour locations. The main purpose is to help tourism companies to manage tour packages. The system can also be used for both professional and business trips.

-> Thus, we have developed a program to provide the best travelling services to the customers and travel agents. The Tourism Management System provides a search platform where a tourist can find their tour places according to their choices. This system also helps to promote responsible and interesting tourism so that people can enjoy their holidays at their favorable places and develop tourism with different cultures so that they enrich the tourism experience and build pride. The objective of this project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel agency. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly.
